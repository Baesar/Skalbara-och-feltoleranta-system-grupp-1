## Tutorial :

step 1 : Open a command prompt for both frontend folder and backend folder

step 2 : Do "npm install" on both command prompts . If something is later amis go to installs.txt and take the appropriate install commands and paste them into the command prompt . There is one for backend and front end .

step 3 : in backend directory create a .env file and write the following 
```
PORT=5000
ATLAS_URI="your uri" // get this from Ash via huah21vn@student.ju.se
SECRET=baesargreaterthanashbenlolo
EMAIL_ADDRESS=information.getbetter@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=ytkfipciftkduijx
```

for this you need to connect to a database. Mind ours is not in this readme file for privacy reasons. Ask Ahmed Hussein for it at huah21vn@student.ju.se
